# About
This repository contains the `.tex` files for my CV.

# Build
You need to have `pdflatex` installed.

Once installed, run:

```console
$ pdflatex cv.tex
```

A `pdf` file called `cv.pdf` will be created.

# Template
This CV is heavily based on [this](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/developer-cv) CV template.
